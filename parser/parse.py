        # What does the `__init__` method do?
            This method will be called immediately upon creating an object. It's a useful
            way to assign baseline attributes of the class (in this case making the filename
            accessible by all methods) but also to run preliminary code or assertions (like 
            checking to see if the file exists at all!)
           
        # Should I ever call the `__init__` method? 
            Like most hidden methods (the double underscored names) this is not generally something
            you call from the outside of a class. However, if you need to specificy a different
            `__init__` method for a subclass you will need to call this with the `Super` keyword. We
            won't get into this now, but if you are interested feel free to reach out to the TAs or
            check out the documentation on the `Super` keyword.

        # What's the deal with calling a method by almost the same name?
            it is common in python to see a public method calling a hidden method
            with a similar name. Both of these are accessible to a user (nothing is truly hidden in python)
            but it is a useful way to separate out Class and SubClass specific behavior. 
        
            In this case, we know that the function will return either a tuple of 2 or a tuple of 3. 
            But it is up to the subclass method to define what tuple it will return. 
        
        # Do I need to do this with all my classes?
            Absolutely not. But we want to show you some things you will see often when reading python code
            and give an explanation for why certain practices exist in the language.

        This is an overriding of the Base Class Iterable function. All classes in python
        have this function, but it is not implemented for all classes in python. 

        # Note on the `__iter__` method
            Generally one doesn't call this method directly as `obj.__iter__()`. Instead it
            lets you use the object itself as an iterable. This is really useful in OOP because it
            allows you to represent and use iterable objects very cleanly. You still can call this
            method directly, but it really takes the fun out of python...

        # Why you should care about generators

            The expected behavior of this function is to create a generator which will lazily load
            the next item in its queue. These are very useful for many bioinformatic tools where you
            don't need everything loaded at once and instead are interested in interacting with the 
            stream (i.e. you need every value once and won't need it again after you use it). This saves
            quite a bit of memory, especially when you are working with billions of sequences and don't 
            need to keep all of them in memory. 
        
        # Distinction between generator functions and other functions
        
            instead of returning a value with the keyword `return`
            a generator must return a value with the keyword `yield`.

            This `yield` keyword will not shortcut the loop it is nested in like a return will
            and instead will pause the loop until the object is taken from it.

        # sometimes close a file before everything you expect to be written/read is written/read.
